# Fillit
✅ Project score: 100/100 ✅  
Fillit is a project that tackles a common challenge in programming: searching for an optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable amount of time. In this project, we were instructed to find a way to assemble a given set of Tetrimino pieces in the smallest possible square.

I did this project with fellow student [ninjapiraatti](https://github.com/ninjapiraatti), it was glorious!  

## How to use it:  
Clone the repo and run the following command:  
```
./fillit ./tests/{valid_files or invalid_files}/{filename}
```
