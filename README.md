✅ Project score: 100/100 ✅  
Fillit is a project that tackles a common challenge in programming: searching for an optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable amount of time. In this project, we were instructed to find a way to assemble a given set of Tetrimino pieces in the smallest possible square. It was glorious!
